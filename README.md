# MurderMysterySolver

This repository contains the resources (dissertation, source code, images, dataset) for my final Master Project entitled "A Data Science Approach to Murder Mysteries".

This project aimed at creating a mobile application using Machine Learning to help detective novels readers to identify the murderer.

This repository contains 4 folders:
- android, which contains the source code for the Android application, 
	as well as screenshots of the app;
- backend, which contains a script to extract data from the Goodreads website, stored in the "webspider" subfolder, and Java programs used to process the data gathered, as well as the experiments run to assess the accuracy of the predictions;
- datasets, which contains the training set in .arff and .csv formats;
- dissertation, which contains the source files of the dissertation.
